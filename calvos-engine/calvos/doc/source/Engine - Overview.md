# Calvos Engine

Calvos Engine is in charge of processing a project with user inputs and generating the corresponding C source code. This engine is composed of the following elements:

- Calvos components: building blocks for generation of code within the engine. A component is intended to encapsulate a given set of features to which source code will be generated. E.g., a component can encapsulate serial communications artifacts, another one will model the generation of SW timers, etc. 
- Project parser: processes a user's calvos project invoking the necessary components to generate the output source code.
- Engine-level parameters: an infrastructure for providing configurations about the engine behaviors.
- Documenting system

## Calvos Components

The components are the building blocks within the calvos engine. A component has the following elements:

- *(Required)* **Name**: unique name across all defined components. A short name or acronym of the components intention and compliant with C-identifier syntax except by not starting with "_".

  E.g., "aComponent"

- *(Required)* **Body**: a python module implementing the component. This python module has the same name as the component's name. 

  E.g., aComponent.py

- *(Required)* A **component descriptor file** (CDF): An XML file describing the component. This CFD also has the same name as the component's name and shall be compliant with the schema "_component_defs.xsd".

  E.g., aComponent.xml

  This file contains, among other information, the following data about the component:

  - Name
  - Description
  - Allowed component's multiplicity
  - List of associated User Input Templates (UIT)
  - List of associated Source File Templates (SFT)
  - Definition of component-level configurable parameters

- *(Optional)* Set of **user input templates**: Templates for the user to define the elements to be generated by the component, configure their behaviors, etc. These templates are a set of LibreOffice ODS files or XML files.

- *(Optional)* Set of **C source files templates**: Templates used for the generation of C source code for the component. These templates are .c and/or .h files containing the information to generate the source code. This is achieved by interleaving static C-code with python code ready to be parsed with the "cogapp" python module.

- *(Optional)* Set of **documents** for the component.

The calvos components have the following files structure:

### Components Container

Multiple components can be contained inside a folder known as "components container". This concept allows the organization of related components into a single container so that the overall file structure doesn't blow-up.

A container has the following files structure:

## Project Parser

This part of the engine is in charge of processing the user's project and trigger each required component to finally generate the output source-code.

### Calvos Project

A **calvos project** is the entry point for the processing of a user project.

A calvos project has the following elements:

- A project description file: an XML file compliant with the schema "_calvos_project.xsd".

  E.g., "A calvos project.xml"

- A set of user input files

The **project description file** contains the following elements: 

- Project Name: user defined name.
- Project information: user defined data like description, version, date, etc.
- Set of components: the user specifies which calvos components to use for the project. For each component the user needs to indicate which user input files to use and their locations.
- Project-specific values for engine-level parameters.

**User input files**:

- A set of ODS or XML files with the user's definitions for the elements to generate for each component used in the project.
- The user input files need to follow the user input template(s) defined for each component used in the project. 

Suggested project file structure:

The user can freely define a different structure as long as the exact location of each referenced user input file is provided in the project description file. 

### Project Processing

The project parser takes the project description file and invokes each of the referenced components. Each invoked component will parse the required user input files and generate the corresponding c-source code.

The default file structure of a processed calvos project looks as follows:

The location where to place the generated source code, documentation, translated templates, etc. is customizable by the user by project-level parameters.

During the processing of the project, the calvos engine generates a log file with messages thrown during such processing. It is important that the user analyze the contents of the log file to identify possible warnings or errors that could've occurred during the generation of the source-code. The verbosity level of this log file can be determined during the calvos engine invocation by command line arguments.
